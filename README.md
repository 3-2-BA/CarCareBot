# üè• AI Healthcare Scanner

## üìñ Introduction
Health centers often have long waiting times and overworked medical staff, especially during patient triage. Manual patient examinations by nurses or doctors with traditional methods can delay urgent care for critical patients.

This project aims to develop an AI-powered healthcare scanner that can automatically detect and measure a patient's condition as soon as they enter a healthcare facility. Similar to store security scanners that alert for unpaid merchandise, this system will use artificial intelligence and sensors to scan patients quickly, analyze health metrics, and determine the urgency of their condition.

Using AI and machine learning, the solution aims to:
- Reduce waiting times with automated triage.
- Prioritize urgent patients for immediate treatment.
- Support healthcare professionals by providing AI-backed insights.
- Improve efficiency in clinics, hospitals, and emergency services

This innovation helps create a smarter, more efficient, and patient-focused healthcare system.
