## üè¢ Business Background

Healthcare facilities worldwide often struggle with **high patient volumes**, limited medical staff, and manual triage processes that can slow down critical care. In many clinics and hospitals, patients wait for long periods before being assessed, which can sometimes result in delays for those with urgent conditions. 

Traditional triage relies heavily on human assessment, which is **time-consuming**, **subjective**, and prone to human error. With the growing demand for healthcare services, there is a clear need for **technology-driven solutions** that can assist medical staff, optimize patient flow, and ensure timely treatment for critical cases.

The AI Healthcare Scanner project addresses this gap by introducing **automated triage technology** that can quickly assess patient conditions, prioritize care, and support healthcare professionals in delivering efficient and safe services.
